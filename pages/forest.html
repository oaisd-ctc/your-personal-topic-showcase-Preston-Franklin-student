                </header>
                <p>Forests are categorized as a group of trees that surround a large area. They can be categorized by
                    factors such as the type of trees and the density
                    of the trees found in the forest. Some of the geograhpical features in forests include creeks and
                    ravines.

                </header>
                <p>Forests are mainly dominated by trees with diferent forests containing different kinds of trees. Most
                    forests contain common trees such as Maple, Oak, and
                    White Pine while others contain rarer trees such as Redwood. While uncommon, smaller plants and
                    shrubs can be found on the forest floor as well occasional
                    patches of moss. It is also common to find fallen trees lying in the middle of the forest floor.

                    <h2>Animals</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The common animal found in forest is the squirrel. There are three kinds of squirrels found in
                    forests which are the brown squirrel, black squirrel, and grey
                    squirrel. Rarer animals include deer and rabbits. In extremely race cases, grizzly bears and grey
                    wolfs can be found in large forests

        </header>
        <p class="bog">Very rarely a bog may form in the middle of a forest. Bogs are temporary swamp-like biomes
            that can occur after a heavy rainfall in a forest.
            They tend to be very muddy and small lakes that are very deep can be found in or around bogs. The
            wildlife doesn't change except for the addition of
            animals such as turtles. Bogs are smaller in size and they last for 3-4 months.
